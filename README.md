# netlify-auth-providers

A JavaScript library to use Netlify's OAuth providers, it relies on a popup which may cause issues with popup blockers e.g. in Firefox.

For a "popup-less" alternative that uses a widget overlay and offers multiple authentication options, try [`netlify-identity-widget`](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget) instead.

You can check an example React implementation/usage here: https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-github-profile/blob/b0c6a4628535fcea32f4f6617efd03f6b29574f4/src/github-client.js#L1

Full setup instructions can be found in the [Netlify OAuth provider docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers).
